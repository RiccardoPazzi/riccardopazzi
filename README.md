# Hey! Welcome to my Github profile 👋
My name is Riccardo Pazzi, I am a Student majoring in Data science with a minor in I&E @ EIT Digital. 
I'm currently living in Milan🏙️ while studying @ Politecnico di Milano and this September I'll be ✈️ to Université Côte d'Azur to complete my double degree.

## 🔥 What I'm passionate about
🔎 I am curious about how things work, especially in physics and computer science.
This results in me buying wayyy to many textbooks, even if I don't have the time to read them all.

⛰️🤿 I love nature and exercising, I trek and I go scuba diving every so often

🗣️ I'm passionate about explaining science and reaching people outside the university bubble, so I volunteer @OnAir a student association which organizes science talks and events open to everybody
