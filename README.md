# Hey! Welcome to my Github profile 👋
My name is Riccardo Pazzi, I have a MSc in Data science with a minor in I&E under the EIT Digital consortium. 
I'm currently working as a ML engineer, developing privacy-preserving solutions @ Dhiria.
I've studied @ Université Côte d'Azur, and my first MSc year @ Politecnico di Milano, Milan.

## 🔥 What I'm passionate about
🔎 I am curious about how things work, especially in physics, mathematics and computer science.
This results in me buying wayyy too many textbooks for the spare time I have.

⛰️🤿 I love nature and exercising, I trek and go scuba diving every so often.
 
🗣️ I'm passionate about explaining science and reaching people outside the university bubble, so I volunteer @ OnAir a student association which organizes science talks and events for the general public.
