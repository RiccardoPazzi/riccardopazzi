## üî• What I'm passionate about
üîé I am curious about how things work, especially in physics and computer science.
This results in me buying wayyy too many textbooks for the spare time I have.

‚õ∞Ô∏èü§ø I love nature and exercising, I trek and go scuba diving every so often.

üó£Ô∏è I'm passionate about explaining science and reaching people outside the university bubble, so I volunteer @OnAir a student association which organizes science talks and events for the general public.
